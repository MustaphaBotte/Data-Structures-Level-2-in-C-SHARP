# 📘 Data Structures – Level 2 in C#

## 👋 About This Repository

This repository represents **my learning journey through Advanced Data Structures in C#**.

Here, I **will study and learn** advanced data structures in C# **topic by topic**.

As I progress through the course, I will **push each topic separately**, including:

* Clear explanations in my own words
* Practical C# examples
* Comparisons between similar data structures
* Notes about when and why to use each one

The goal of this repository is to **document my learning process**, not to rush or dump everything at once. Each data structure will be added **only after I properly understand it**.

This is not about memorizing names — it’s about **building the right developer mindset**.

## 🧠 My Background Before This Course

Before starting this course, I already built strong foundations in:

* Problem solving and logical thinking
* Clean code and Divide & Conquer techniques
* C# fundamentals and real applications
* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
* Databases and data-driven systems

Because of that, I’m now ready to learn **advanced data structures** without confusion or fear.

---

## 🎯 My Goal From This Course

By the end of this course, my goal is to move from:

> “I know arrays and linked lists”

To:

> “I can choose and design the right data structure for real systems.”

I focus on:

* Understanding **trade-offs** (performance, memory, simplicity)
* Writing **correct and efficient C# code**
* Thinking like a **performance-aware backend developer**

## 📚 What I Will Learn and Push Here

Everything I learn **will be pushed gradually**, with examples, comparisons, and real usage scenarios, as I move forward in the course.

### 🔹 C# Collections & Performance

* Generic vs Non-Generic collections and why they matter
* Avoiding performance issues like **boxing/unboxing**
* Deep understanding and usage of:

  * `List` vs `ArrayList`
  * `Hashtable` vs `Dictionary`
  * `HashSet`, `SortedSet`
  * `SortedList`, `SortedDictionary`
  * `ObservableCollection`

### 🔹 Practical Operations on Collections

* Searching, filtering, and sorting correctly
* `Contains` vs `Exists` vs `Any`
* `TryGetValue`
* Removing duplicates
* Set operations (Union, Intersection, Difference)
* Advanced LINQ patterns with real objects

### 🔹 Mastering Arrays

* Multidimensional arrays
* Jagged arrays
* Copying strategies
* Advanced array operations
* Using LINQ efficiently with arrays

### 🔹 Memory-Efficient Structures

* `BitArray`
* Bitwise operations and real use cases

### 🔹 Modern C# Features

* Tuples
* LINQ with tuples

### 🔹 Interfaces & Custom Collections

* Understanding and using:

  * `IEnumerable`
  * `ICollection`
  * `IList`
  * `IDictionary`
  * `ISet`
* Implementing **custom collections**
* Implementing `IComparable` for correct sorting of custom objects

### 🔹 Advanced Data Structures (Will Be Implemented From Scratch)

* Trees

  * General Tree
  * Binary Tree
  * Tree traversals (Preorder, Inorder, Postorder)
* Graphs

  * Adjacency Matrix
  * Adjacency List
* Heaps

  * Min-Heap
  * Max-Heap
* Priority Queue using a Min-Heap

---

## 🧱 How I Structure My Learning

* Review core concepts before moving forward
* Compare similar data structures to understand **when to use each**
* Write clean, readable C# code
* Focus on **understanding first**, not over-practicing
* Push every data structure with examples and explanations

Deep problem solving and stress testing will come **after** I fully understand the concepts.

---

## ⚠️ Important Note

This repository is focused on **clear understanding**, not heavy algorithmic grinding.

* I learn what each data structure is
* Why it exists
* When and why I should use it
* What trade-offs it has

Strong understanding first → meaningful practice later.

## 🧑‍💻 Who This Repository Is For

This repository may help:

* C# developers strengthening backend foundations
* Students learning advanced data structures
* Anyone who wants to **stop guessing** and start **choosing the right data structure**

It is **not intended for absolute beginners**.

---

## 🏁 Expected Outcome

After completing this course and building this repository step by step, I expect to:

* Think like a performance-aware developer
* Choose the correct data structure instead of guessing
* Design smarter systems in C#
* Understand advanced backend and algorithm topics more easily
* Read complex code with confidence — not fear 🚀
